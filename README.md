Main:

Fhcalc.py: Functions used for generating a screen, including initialization, Gaussian illumination, circular truncation, FFT, interpolation, etc.

ErrMask.py: Functions used for generating errors, including amplitude and phase errors, and rms calculation

ErrorMask.ipynb: Plots the annular noise filter and filtered noise, and compares unperturbed and perturbed screens.
