# Effects of CMB Telescope Beam Systematics on Measurements of B-Mode Polarization

## Main - main calculation


### Fhcalc.py: 
Functions used for generating a screen, including initialization, Gaussian illumination, circular truncation, FFT, interpolation, etc.

### ErrMask.py: 
Functions used for generating errors, including amplitude and phase errors, and rms calculation

### ErrorMask.ipynb: 
Plots the annular noise filter and filtered noise, and compares unperturbed and perturbed screens.

### BEAM_test_new.py: 
Tests if numerical & analytical beam window functions are consistent (no errors yet)

### BEAM_error_difference.py: 
Compares the beam window difference between a perturbed and unperturbed one.

### BEAM_leakage.py: 
Generates a plot of leakage level (error^2) as a function of error amplitude for the fixed k_in=15 and k_out=25 and after noise normalization
